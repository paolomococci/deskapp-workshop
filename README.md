# webapp-workshop

## Web application workshop

Some demos written in Java and Kotlin programming languages, using Spring Boot version 2 and Vaadin version 17 frameworks.
Additionally, a demo uses Groovy templates and Bootstrap 4.

## expected results
It was my intention to write a multi-level applications.
Bottom, there is the webapp-restful-provider application that takes care of storing the data on the backend and exposes the same data through RESTful services.
Above, so to speak, are the web applications that read and interpret the data returned by the RESTful service, exposing them in tabular form to the user.
In addition, they provide the user with a convenient CRUD module.
The user can delete, modify and add new items thanks to an intuitive web Graphical User Interface.

## achieved results
I believe I am on the right track.
Using only open source resources I have developed demos that take into consideration the hottest concepts of the moment such as Microservices, Reactive Programming and Backpressure.

### please note
As my habit, I don't add files generated by build automation tools to the repository.
