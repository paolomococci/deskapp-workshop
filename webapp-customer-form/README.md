## expected results
It was my intention to write a multi-level application.
Where, below, there is the application that takes care of storing data on the backend and exposes the same data through RESTful services.
Above, so to speak, is the web application which reads and interprets the data returned by the RESTful service and exposes them in tabular form to the user.
In addition, it provides the user with a convenient CRUD module.
With which it can interact with data.
The user can delete, modify and add new items.

## achieved results
