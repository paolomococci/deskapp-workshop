# webapp-employee-react

After creating the project with the command:
```
npx create-react-app webapp-employee-react
```
I changed the directory with:
```
cd webapp-employee-react
```
And from within the project directory, I installed Bootstrap with the following command:
```
npm i bootstrap
```
and then Axios with:
```
npm i axios
```
or you can use yarn as below:
```
yarn add bootstrap
```
and:
```
yarn add axios
```
Finally I add react-feather:
```
npm i react-feather
```
